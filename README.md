Description
----------------------------------------------------------------------

### DataFlexor is a data management framework to allow easy extension of WordPress content.

Based upon the excellent Advanced Custom Fields, DataFlexor gives WordPress an easy to use 
way to create complex systems.

Rather than have to create a Custom Post Type for each post type simply take a single 
Custom Post Type and extend it with field groups. These can then be used to customize 
any post with both data and functionality.

With a hierarchy structure you can then create many systems from a help desk to a staff 
directory, in fact almost anything that has a need for a flexible data structure.
